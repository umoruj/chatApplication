# Chat Application

The application was built without the use of storyboard as a first for me, and the backend for the application was implemented using Firebase mobile and Web application platform. It features a login/register interface with profile image upload and send messages between registered users and more features still under construction.

implemented using swift 3.0.1 with Xcode 8.1

Functionalities currently implemented:
1. Register Users.
2. User Login.
3. send messages to Firebase.
4. Retrieve messages from Firebase.
5. View messages from both parties dependent on who is logged in.
6. Support multiple users efficiently.
