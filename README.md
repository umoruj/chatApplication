# Chat Application

The application was built without the use of storyboard as a first for me, and the backend for the application was implemented using Firebase mobile and Web application platform. It features a login/register interface with profile image upload and send messages between registered users and more features still under construction.

implemented using swift 3.0.1 with Xcode 8.1

Functionalities currently implemented:
1. Register Users via email and password.
2. User Login via email and password.
3. Send and recieve messages between users in real time.
